# CodeGenerationAgent

The `CodeGenerationAgent` is responsible for generating code snippets or entire files based on tasks received.

## Key Responsibilities:

-   **Task Processing:**
    -   Listens for `Task` objects on the `code_generation_tasks` channel of the message bus.
    -   Processes tasks that are targeted to it.
-   **Code Generation (Simulated):**
    -   Currently simulates code generation for a few predefined requests (e.g., a "hello world" Python function, a sum function).
    -   If a request is unsupported or unclear, it generates a failure result.
-   **Result Publishing:**
    -   Creates an `ExecutionResult` object containing the status (completed/failed), the generated code (or an error message in `output`), and any error details.
    -   Publishes the `ExecutionResult` to a dedicated channel for the originating agent (e.g., `task_results_{task.source_agent_id}`).
-   **Lifecycle Management:** Uses `start_listening()` to begin listening for tasks and `stop_listening()` for graceful shutdown.

## Current Implementation:

-   The agent's logic resides in `generator.py`.
-   It uses the global `message_bus` from `novapilot_core` for communication.
-   The code generation logic is currently a simple simulation and will be expanded for more complex scenarios.

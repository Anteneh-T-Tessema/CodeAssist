# Windsurf: End-to-End Software Development Agent

This project aims to build an advanced AI-powered software development assistant. It is composed of several specialized agents that collaborate to provide a comprehensive development environment.

## Project Structure

The core of the project is organized into the following agent modules, located in the `windsurf_agents` directory:

- **UserInteractionOrchestratorAgent**: Manages communication and task flow between the user and other agents.
- **CodeUnderstandingAgent**: Analyzes and understands existing codebases.
- **CodeGenerationAgent**: Generates new code based on requirements.
- **CodeCompletionAgent**: Provides intelligent code completion suggestions.
- **DebuggingAgent**: Helps identify and fix bugs in code.
- **AutomatedTestingAgent**: Generates and runs automated tests.
- **RefactoringAgent**: Assists in restructuring and improving existing code.
- **DocumentationAgent**: Generates and maintains project documentation.
- **VulnerabilityScanAgent**: Scans code for security vulnerabilities.
- **EnvironmentManagementAgent**: Manages development environments and dependencies.
- **PlatformIntegrationAgent**: Integrates with various development platforms and tools.
- **VersionControlAgent**: Handles version control operations (e.g., Git).
- **KnowledgeBaseAgent**: Manages and retrieves information relevant to the development process.
- **AgentLifecycleManagerAgent**: Manages the lifecycle of the different agents.
- **AgentSandboxAgent**: Provides a sandboxed environment for code execution and testing.

Further details about each agent and their functionalities will be added as development progresses.
